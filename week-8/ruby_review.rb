# Create a Bingo Scorer (SOLO CHALLENGE)

# I spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# Pseudocode
# Check if 5 spaces in a row (horizontal, diagonal, or vertical) on a bingo board have an x to see if a it is a bingo winner.
#Step 1: check to see if a row in an array has all 'x's.
#Step 2: check to see if the same index position in different rows has an x.
#Step 3: check to see if a board has diagonal x.




# sample boards

# DRIVER TESTS GO BELOW THIS LINE
# implement tests for each of the methods here:
p "And for the 'horizontal' board..."
scorer1 = BingoScorer.new(horizontal)

p "And for 'vertical' board ..."
scorer2 = BingoScorer.new(vertical)

p "And for the 'right_to_left' board... "
scorer3 = BingoScorer.new(right_to_left)

p "And for the 'left_to_right' board... "

# Reflection
=begin
- What concepts did you review or learn in this challenge?
  This helped my understanding of iteration and also refactoring. I really tried to get rid of unnecessary steps. I'm sure I have a few extra variables, but this was the best I could do for now.

- What is still confusing to you about Ruby?
  I'm still learning about all the different methods that are at my disposal. I just learned about the '.all?'' method, which I'm sure will come in handy down the line.

- What are you going to study to get more prepared for Phase 1?
  The different methods at my disposal and I'll try to refactor as often as possible.
