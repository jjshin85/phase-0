    - What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
      It was much more tedious and time consuming than I intitially thought it would be because it took a long time to check everything. While working with my partner, everything was good, we focused on getting a functional skeleton down, but then afterwards when I was checking things on my own and editing the document, I realized I needed to learn more about html.
    - How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
      It was fine, it made a lot of sense, but I'd like to look at more examples to see exactly how I should use elements to organize a site, such as when to use 'article' and when to use 'section' or if it really matters.
    - How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
      It was occassionally difficult to remember what the best practices were, but as we went through the exercise and fiddled with what worked and what didn't, and just generally revising and editing the document, it because easier to keep to those best practices and understand why.
    - What seems good and bad about HTML?
      HTML seems good in the way it encapsulates objects, but adding styles and other symbols seems tedious at first.
    - What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
      Basically trying to know the different semantic elements and thinking about hierarchy of elements to know how to organize and encapsulate them.
