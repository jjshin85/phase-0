- A wireframe is basically a layout of what your site will look like. It is how you organize everything on the page, how you lead the eye of the viewer, and how the information on the page is organized hierarchically.

- The benefits of wireframing are that it let's you figure out how you want to organize info on your page and how you want to design the interaction with the user, how you lead the user through your site and how the user interacts with it.

- I enjoyed wireframing my site, but so far it's a bit sparse.

- My final version was pretty close to my original idea. But seeing as this is an iterative process, I'm sure I'll make more changes down the line.

- During this challenge, I asked what were the essential things the user should have access to, how prominent should they be on the page, what order should I show them in, and how prominent should they be in relation to each other. These are more design questions, and I didn't really look at resources so much as look at other webpages I frequent and asked myself what I liked about their designs and why.

- I enjoyed the design aspect and the sketching, but trying to sketch on the computer and trying to find a program to make a wireframe with was tedious and I preferred to stick with my old ways of pen and paper. I did measure things out a bit and make a grid, which would've been easier had I used a computer template or if I had an easier time using the wire-framing template websites/apps.
