# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
The unique ruby methods I used for my assignments were .push, include?, and .to_s.
.push adds an element to an array.
include? will check an element for the presence of a specified character. The one
hitch with .include? is that it is a string method, meaning it will not run on
elements of any other class. That is where the .to_s method came in. Because the
array contains integers, we must turn them into strings before they can be successfully
evaluated.

# Person 2: Nicola
# pseudocode
# input: name of array or hash you want to modify and number that adds to or replaces age data
# output: modified array or hash with updated integer data
# select integers in source array/hash
# either add or replace integers with input
# return same source array/hash that has been changed

def my_array_modification_method!(source, thing_to_modify)
  source.map! {|x| x.is_a?(Integer) ? x + thing_to_modify : x}
  return source
end

def my_hash_modification_method!(source, thing_to_modify)
  source.each { |pet, age| source[pet] = age + thing_to_modify }
 return source
end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# map! - iterates over each element in the array and modifies the array so each element is changed
#          according to the code in the block
# is_a?(Integer) - this method checks each element in the array to see if it is an integer
# I tried to use each_value for the hash modification, but couldn't figure out how to reassign
# the age value without referencing the key. Let me know if anyone used that method to alter just the values.

def my_array_sorting_method(source)

  sorted_array = source.clone

  sorted_array.sort!  { |a, b| a.to_s <=> b.to_s }

   sorted_age_hash = source.sort_by {|key, value| value }

end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# .clone' was used to clone the original array so I wouldn't alter its data and so the new array would have a different object id.
# '.sort!'' to reorder the array
# '.to_s' to convert the integers to strings while sorting so that there wouldn't be a type error
# '.sort_by' to sort the values of a hash. '.sort_by' allowed me to pass in two variables, the key and the value, and specifiy which one I wanted to sort.

# Release 1: Identify and describe the Ruby method you implemented. Teach your
# accountability group how to use the methods.
# I'm going to copy and paste my comments from above:
# .clone' was used to create a duplicate of it so it wouldn't alter the data of the original array and so the new array would have a different object id because the 'pointer' of the variable name would be pointing to a different location/object.
# '.sort!'' to reorder the array
# '.to_s' to convert the integers to strings while sorting so that there wouldn't be a type error when comparing the two
# '.sort_by' to sort the values of a hash. '.sort_by' allowed me to pass in two variables, the key and the value, and specifiy which one I wanted to sort.

# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
# When researching, I googled the data type I wanted to work with and the type of action I was trying to do. Also, when the Ruby docs were particularly hard to understand, usually I could find a blog (maybe someone's DBC homework) that explained things.
