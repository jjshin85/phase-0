# Person 1's solution
def my_array_finding_method(source, thing_to_find)
  source # This line is here to make sure all tests initially fail. Delete it when you begin coding.
end

def my_hash_finding_method(source, thing_to_find)
  source # This line is here to make sure all tests initially fail. Delete it when you begin coding.
end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.

# Person 2
def my_array_modification_method!(source, thing_to_modify)
  source.dup # This line is here to make sure all tests initially fail. Delete it when you begin coding.
end

def my_hash_modification_method!(source, thing_to_modify)

# Person 3
def my_array_sorting_method(source)
  sorted_array = source.clone

  sorted_array.sort!  { |a, b| a.to_s <=> b.to_s }
  return sorted_array
end

def my_hash_sorting_method(source)
   sorted_age_hash = source.sort_by {|key, value| value }
   return sorted_age_hash
end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# I used '.clone' to clone the original array as to not alter its data.
# '.sort!'' to reorder the array
# '.to_s' to convert the integers to strings while sorting so that there wouldn't be a type error
# '.sort_by' to sort the values of a hash. '.sort_by' allowed me to pass in two variables, the key and the value, and specifiy which one I wanted to sort.


# Person 4
def my_array_deletion_method!(source, thing_to_delete)
  source.dup # This line is here to make sure all tests initially fail. Delete it when you begin coding.
end

def my_hash_deletion_method!(source, thing_to_delete)
  source.dup # This line is here to make sure all tests initially fail. Delete it when you begin coding.
end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.

# Person 5
def my_array_splitting_method(source)
  source # This line is here to make sure all tests initially fail. Delete it when you begin coding.
end

def my_hash_splitting_method(source, age)
  source # This line is here to make sure all tests initially fail. Delete it when you begin coding.
end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.

# Release 1: Identify and describe the Ruby method you implemented. Teach your
# accountability group how to use the methods.
#
#
#


# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
